# 🧠 Node.js Practice

Hey there! 👋 On the way to my **web development journey**, I’ve started exploring **Node.js** and wanted to share some of my practice work here.

This one is a simple command-line task handler just something I built while learning how file systems and basic CLI inputs work in Node.js.

---

## 📁 What's in the folder?

- `ToDo.js` – The main file where all the logic is written
- `ToDo.json` – A file that stores the tasks (like a mini memory)

---

## 📌 What does it do?

You can run basic commands in the terminal to:

- **Add** a task
- **Remove** a task
- **List** all tasks
- **View help** instructions

Everything is stored inside a `ToDo.json` file.

---

## 🚀 How to Run

Make sure you have Node.js installed.

Create a file called `ToDo.json` and put an empty array in it to start:

```bash
[]
node ToDo.js Add "Welcome to Asad's Repository"
node ToDo.js Remove 1
node ToDo.js List
node ToDo.js Help
```
